::alert
If you're looking for the supabase v1 documentation (v0.1.x of this module), please check it [here](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/supabase/blob/main/docs/content-v1/3.usage/1.composables/1.use-supabase-client.md).
::

[Auto-import](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables) your client inside your vue files.

This composable is using [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/) under the hood, it gives access to the [Supabase client](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/initializing).

> The client is initialized with the `SUPABASE_KEY` you must have in your `.env` file. It establishes the connection with the database and make use of user JWT to apply [RLS Policies](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security) implemented in Supabase. If you want to bypass policies, you can use the [serverSupabaseServiceRole](/usage/services/server-supabase-service-role).

## Database Request

Please check [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select) documentation to fully use the power of Supabase client.

Here is an example of a fetch using the `select` method with Nuxt 3 [useAsyncData](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#useasyncdata) composable.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const client = useSupabaseClient()

const { data: restaurant } = await useAsyncData('restaurant', async () => {
  const { data } = await client.from('restaurants').select('name, location').eq('name', 'My Restaurant Name').single()

  return data
})
</script>
```

## Realtime

Based on [Supabase Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime), listen to changes in your PostgreSQL Database and broadcasts them over WebSockets. 

To enable it, make sure you have turned on the [Realtime API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#realtime-api) for your table.

Then, listen to changes directly in your vue page / component:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { RealtimeChannel } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const client = useSupabaseClient()

let realtimeChannel: RealtimeChannel

// Fetch collaborators and get the refresh method provided by useAsyncData
const { data: collaborators, refresh: refreshCollaborators } = await useAsyncData('collaborators', async () => {
  const { data } = await client.from('collaborators').select('name')
  return data
})

// Once page is mounted, listen to changes on the `collaborators` table and refresh collaborators when receiving event
onMounted(() => {
  // Real time listener for new workouts
  realtimeChannel = client.channel('public:collaborators').on(
    'postgres_changes',
    { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'collaborators' },
    () => refreshCollaborators()
  )

  realtimeChannel.subscribe()
})

  // Don't forget to unsubscribe when user left the page
onUnmounted(() => {
  client.removeChannel(realtimeChannel)
})
</script>
```

## Typescript

You can pass Database typings to the client. Check Supabase [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/release-notes#typescript-support) for further information.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { Database } from '~/types'
const client = useSupabaseClient<Database>()
</script>
```
