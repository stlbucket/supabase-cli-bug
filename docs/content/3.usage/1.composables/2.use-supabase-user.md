Once logged in, you can [auto-import](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables) your user everywhere inside your vue files.

```vue
<script setup>
const user = useSupabaseUser()
</script>
```

## Auth middleware

You can protect your authenticated routes by creating a custom middleware in your project, here is an example:

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, _from) => {
  const user = useSupabaseUser()

  if (!user.value) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

Then you can reference your middleware in your page with:

```ts [pages/dashboard.vue]
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth'
})
```
